how static makes it easy to call methods 
: though not a good following up on SOLID
: the methods should be distributed into various interfaces to make it easier to maintain and then reuse
: testing in such case would be easier as well

 was doing this mini project to find out usefulness of 
*static variables and static methods
*implement binary algorithm for string/string buffer permetuations
*string to string buffer and reverse conversions
*relevant functions
*junit testing
