- Identify individual business requirements
- Write one or more Test Conditions to cover each individual requirement
- Prioritise Test Conditions
- Write a Test Case for each Test Condition

traceability helps in => impact analysis => requirement coverage => Linkage from requirement to test case 


black box also known as Specification based testing
- based upon analysis of specifications
- can be functional and non-functional
- of a component/system without reference to its internal structure

Decision Table Testing



White Box (Structural) Testing
Documented procedure to derive and select test cases based on analysing the internal structure of a component/system.

Also known as Structural based testing.





Statement coverage
Decision Decision coverage
Condition testing
Multi condition testing
Modified condition coverage


can be applied at: Component - Integration – System




Error Guessing known as a Fault AttackOne way of doing this is : Exploratory Testing



2 types of experience-based techniques 
-Error Guessing
-Exploratory Testing


Which of the following is MOST important when deciding which testing technique to use?
Test objectives



The choice of which technique to use depends on:
Test objectives
Type and level of risk
Time and budget
Documentation available
Knowledge of testers


Tester tasks may be done by someone in another role such as:
Developers (Component and Integration testing)
Business Experts and users (Acceptance testing)
Operators (Operational Acceptance Testing)


Test leader may decide
strategy, planning execution and overall approach 
setup and implement configuration management techniques


Test planning

Risk, constraints, resources, criticality
Test policy, scope, objective testablility


- component - integration - System - Acceptance
